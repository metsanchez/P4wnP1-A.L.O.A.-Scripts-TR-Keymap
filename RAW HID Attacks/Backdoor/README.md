### HID backdoor features
- Payload to bridge an Airgap target, by relaying a shell over raw HID and provide it from P4wnP1 via WiFi
- Plug and Play install of HID device on Windows (tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10)
- Covert channel based on raw HID
- Pure **in memory, multi stage payload** - nothing is written to disk, small footprint (compared to typical PowerShell IOCs)
- RAT like control server with custom shell:
    - Auto completition for core commands
	
	- Trigger remote backdoor to bring up HID covert channel
	- creation of **multiple** remote processes (only with covert channel connection)
	- console interaction with managed remote processes (only with covert channel connection)
	- auto kill of remote payload on disconnect
	- `shell` command to  create remote shell (only with covert channel connection)
	- server could be accessed with SSH via WiFi
